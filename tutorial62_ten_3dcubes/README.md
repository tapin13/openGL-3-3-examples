# OpenGL 3.3 Tutorial - Coordinate Systems

Tutorial from https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Coordinate-Systems

Display 10 of our cubes on screen. Each cube will look the same but will only differ in where it's located in the world with each a different rotation. 
The graphical layout of the cube is already defined so we don't have to change our buffers or attribute arrays when rendering more objects. 
The only thing we have to change for each object is its model matrix where we transform the cubes into the world.
