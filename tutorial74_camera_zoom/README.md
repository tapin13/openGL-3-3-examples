# OpenGL 3.3 Tutorial - Camera

Tutorial from https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Camera

Press one of the WASD keys, the camera's position is updated accordingly. 

## Mouse input
The yaw and pitch values are obtained from mouse movement, where horizontal mouse-movement affects the yaw and vertical mouse-movement affects the pitch.

## Mouse scroll
Zooming interface. In the previous tutorial we said the Field of view or fov defines how much we can see of the scene. 
When the field of view becomes smaller the scene's projected space gets smaller giving the illusion of zooming in. 
To zoom in, we're going to use the mouse's scroll-wheel.
