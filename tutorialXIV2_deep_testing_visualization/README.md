# OpenGL 3.3 Tutorial - Visualizing the depth buffer

Tutorial from https://learnopengl.com/Advanced-OpenGL/Depth-testing

We know that the z-value of the built-in gl_FragCoord vector in the fragment shader contains the depth value of that particular fragment.
If we were to output this depth value of the fragment as a color we could display the depth values of all the fragments in the scene.
