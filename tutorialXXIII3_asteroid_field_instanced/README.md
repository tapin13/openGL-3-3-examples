# OpenGL 3.3 Tutorial - Instanced arrays

Drawing a lot of models with same set of vertex data.

Instanced rendering we can now set this value to 100000. 
Only 2 draw calls.

Take a look on number of objects and FPS.

P.S. Looks like of my GTX260 have bug or drivers updated, 
but glDrawElements vs glDrawElementsInstanced give same result.
