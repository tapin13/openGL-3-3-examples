# OpenGL 3.3 Tutorial - Camera

Tutorial from https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Camera

Press one of the WASD keys, the camera's position is updated accordingly. 
If we want to move forward or backwards we add or subtract the direction vector from the position vector. 
If we want to move sidewards we do a cross product to create a right vector and we move along the right vector accordingly.
