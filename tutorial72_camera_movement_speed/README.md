# OpenGL 3.3 Tutorial - Camera

Tutorial from https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Camera

Press one of the WASD keys, the camera's position is updated accordingly. 

People have different processing powers and the result of that is that some people are able to draw much more frames than others each second.
Keep track of a deltatime variable that stores the time it takes to render the last frame. Then multiply all velocities with this deltaTime value.
The velocity of the camera will be balanced out accordingly so each user will have the same experience.
